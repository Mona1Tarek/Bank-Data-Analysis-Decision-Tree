# Bank-Data-Analysis-Decision-Tree

Welcome to the Bank Data Analysis using Decision Tree technique project repository! This project aims to analyze bank data and build a decision tree model for predicting customer behavior or outcomes.

## Overview

Understanding customer behavior and predicting outcomes is crucial for banks to make informed decisions regarding marketing strategies, risk assessment, and customer retention. This project utilizes data analysis techniques and decision tree algorithms to extract insights and build predictive models based on bank-related data.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Explore and analyze bank-related datasets to identify patterns, trends, and correlations.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleanse, transform, and prepare the data for analysis and modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Engineer relevant features from the data to improve the predictive power of the model.
- **Model Training**: Build and train decision tree models to predict customer behavior or outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the decision tree models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Interpretation**: Interpret the decision tree model to gain insights into the factors influencing customer behavior or outcomes.

## Getting Started
